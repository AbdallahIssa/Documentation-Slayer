# Runnable-Info-Extractor

I want to introduce you to this VS-Code extension I have made:

✨ Runnable Info Extractor ✨

This VS-code Extension would save lots of time and effort and reduce the headache of  dummy documentation tasks just by running a command.

All you have to do is run the command. Your output will be parsed into a perfect Excel sheet holding the missing attributes that we're looking for.

The sweetest thing here is that we can use it not only for a specific project,
We can also use it for any project if we have come to this stage of documenting the Runnables and filling their data.

And that's because in the parsing Algorithm, I depended on the structure of the runnable documentation that was generated from daVinci.


Waiting for you to install my extension and start playing with it.
